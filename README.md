# Rising Sun - Find new music without an algorithm

Rising Sun is a website that pulls the best new songs and trending picks from sites curated by real people, not an algorithm. If you want to find new music that spans different genres and is willing to push the boundaries but don't know where to look, then Rising Sun is for you. I designed this to help people who want to explore different kinds of music rather than just consume what an algorithm is feeding them.

Currently a work in progress
